You are working with an existing Next.js / Vite-based blog project.

CRITICAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY):
1. DO NOT add any new folders.
2. DO NOT delete, rename, or move any existing folders.
3. DO NOT change routing, markdown loading logic, server code, scripts, build config, or data flow.
4. DO NOT modify how markdown files are imported or rendered.
5. ONLY UI (branding + styling + layout) changes are allowed.
6. ONLY markdown (.md) files inside `content/posts/` should be removed.
7. No other files should be removed or altered structurally.

## TASKS TO PERFORM

### 1️⃣ Clear Blog Content
- Delete ALL `.md` files inside:
  `content/posts/`
- Keep the folder itself intact.
- Ensure the site loads without errors.
- Display a clean empty-state UI instead of breaking the page.

---

### 2️⃣ Change Brand Name (IMPORTANT)
- Replace the existing brand/site name wherever it appears in the UI:
  - Header
  - Footer
  - Homepage titles
  - Metadata titles (if present in UI files only)
- New brand name to use consistently:
  
  **Brand Name:** `GuestPost Hub`

⚠️ Do NOT change:
- Project name
- Repo name
- Folder names
- Environment variables
- Build files

---

### 3️⃣ UI Redesign ONLY (No logic changes)
Redesign the UI to match a **modern guest-post publishing platform**:

- Clean white background
- Soft grey borders
- Subtle shadows
- Professional editorial typography
- Modern sans-serif font
- Minimal, SEO-focused design
- Header with:
  - Brand name: **GuestPost Hub**
- Footer with simple copyright text

---

### 4️⃣ Empty State UI (Mandatory)
When there are no posts:
- Show a centered message:
  **“No posts published yet.”**
- Optional subtitle:
  *“Guest articles will appear here once published.”*
- This must be UI-only (no logic rewrites).

---

### 5️⃣ Code Safety Rules
- Do NOT change file paths
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies
- Do NOT refactor existing logic
- Do NOT touch `server`, `script`, `shared`, or markdown loader code
- Do NOT modify `dist`

---

## FINAL EXPECTATION
✔ Same project  
✔ Same structure  
✔ Same behavior  
✔ New brand name: **GuestPost Hub**  
✔ Clean redesigned UI  
✔ Blog content cleared safely  
✔ Ready for deployment  

Proceed carefully and conservatively.
